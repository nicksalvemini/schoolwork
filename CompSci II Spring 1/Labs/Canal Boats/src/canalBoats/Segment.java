/**
 * A common type for Locks and FlatStretches.
 * The reason for the common type is to make route building
 * easy. Routes are lists of elements of this type.
 * Pilots arrive and find out if they can navigate through
 * on their own, or need a LockMaster to do it for them.
 *
 * However at this time multiple Locks cannot be in sequence in a route
 * because of the conflict between end and start positions.
 * The same is true of multiple FlatStretches.
