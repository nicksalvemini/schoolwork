1.)     The purpose of the pivot is to be a value that can split the original list
	into to lists, one of values smaller than the pivot, and one of values
	larger than the pivot. We do not need to make the middle item as the
	pivot. In an unsorted list, it does not matter what item is chosen to
	be the pivot value, as the average efficiency will be the same. In a
	sorted list, choosing the first item as the pivot each time would
	drastically decrease efficiency, because the original list would never
	actually be split up, because it would always just be the larger list
	being used.

2.)     To fully exercise quickselect, we could use the following test cases:
	Finding the smallest value in an unsorted list:
		list[40, 56, 32, 17, 90], Expected 17
	Finding the largest value in an unsorted list:
		list[40, 56, 32, 17, 90], Expected 90
	Finding the (k+1)th smallest value in an unsorted list:
		list[40, 56, 32, 17, 90, 62, 88]
			k = 0, Expected 17
			k = 1, Expected 32
			k = 2, Expected 40
			k = 3, Expected 56
			k = 4, Expected 62
			k = 5, Expected 88
			k = 6, Expected 90
3.)     The sorting program takes much longer for large data sets. For the data set
	of 10K buildings, it took about 4.5 seconds each time, and for the data set
	of 25K buildings, it took about 30 seconds each time. For the quickselect
	algorithm, the data set of 10K buildings took about .004 seconds each time,
	while the data set of 25K buildings took about .01 seconds each time.
